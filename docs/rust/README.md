# Introduction

Rust is what we are using for the functionality of this game, the client side is purely focused on UI. I will refer to the Rust side of the app as the "gameflow". For as long as we implement updates and new features, our implementations of gameflow will be rapdily changing. It is important that we begin to document this so that new developers can become familiar with this complicated system, without us explaining it to every new Rust developer.

It is important that for as long as this documentation is used to present to new deveopers, it is updated when any significant changes are made to the architecture of the source code.
